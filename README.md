MapReduce
=========
This project introduces Cloudgene. It shows how a simple WordCount is executed with Hadoop Mapreduce using the standard interfaces. We show how the genepi-hadoop library can be used efficiently to distribute parameters, using the distributed cache or guarantee the correct order of calls.
The tutorial further shows how to plugin applications (such as WordCount) to use it graphically

MapReduce
=========
This tutorial introduces Cloudgene. It shows how a simple WordCount program is designed with Hadoop Mapreduce using the standard interfaces. We introduce the genepi-hadoop library to efficiently distribute parameters, using the distributed cache and guarantee the correct order of calls.
The tutorial further shows how to connect applications (such as WordCount) into Cloudgene to execute them graphically.
